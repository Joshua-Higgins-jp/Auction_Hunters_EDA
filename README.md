#### Joshua Higgins | March~ 2023

## What is *Auction Hunters*?
* Auction hunters is a TV show that aired in the USA from 2010-2015. Hosts Allen and Ton travel and bid for abandoned storage units. Each episode shows where they go, what storage units they bid, how much they win them for, and also shows the most exciting items found in each won unit.
* In each episode, they find buyers for the most profitable items in the storage units they bid on and won.
* The show reports how much each item was sold for, allowing the viewer to keep a tally of their profit for each unit.
* In addition to financial data, we also know where they are and thus can monitor location.

## Description
* This exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a personal project based on the TV Show "Auction Hunters" (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1742340/). 
* Various data such as location and monetary values of purchases and sales are extracted by web scraping and presented in a jupyter notebook.
* This EDA project aims to demonstrate some basic python and data analysis skills to answer questions such as:
   * In which states was the most money spent on stogage units?
   * How much money was made from sales in each state? Each season? In total?
   * Which states were visited most during each season? In total?
